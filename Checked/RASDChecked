INTRODUCTION
  Purpose
    This document represent the Requirement Analysis and Specification Document
    (RASD). The main goal of this document is to completely describe the system
    in terms of functional and non-functional requirements, to show the constraints and the limit
    of the software and simulate the typical use cases that will occur after the
    development. This document is intended to all developer and programmer who
    have to implement the requirements, to system analyst who want to integrate
    other system with this one, and could be used as a contractual basis between
    the customer and the developer.

  Scope of the project
    The aim of this project is to develop MyTaxiService, a web/mobile application that makes easier and quicker taking taxies.
    Thanks to MyTaxiService, anyone can request or book a taxi and get realtime information
    about how long it will take to be picked up or about taxi's current position and code.
    In addition, MyTaxiService provides an efficient way to allocate taxies by dividing the
    city in zones and using a queue based allocation system, in order to reduce the
    waiting time and city's traffic.

  Goals
    In this subsection we describe a set of high level goals that MyTaxiService is proposed to achieve.

    1. Simplify and speed up the process of taking a taxi

      1.1 When a user has entered his taxi ride details and clicks or taps
      the request button, then MyTaxiService will find the first
      available taxi that fits for the inserted ride details, booking it to the user

      1.2 When a user has entered his taxi booking details and clicks or taps
        the book button, then MyTaxiService will book a taxi that fits for the
        inserted booking details and for the indicated meeting time

    2. Guarantee an efficient and fair management of taxi queues

      2.2 Guarantee a right distribution of taxies in the city

      2.3 Guarantee short taxi availability times and short waiting times

  Assumptions
    1. MyTaxiService has been commissioned by the city local government.
      Each taxi in the city must have a taxi license provided by the local government.
      This license requires the registration to MyTaxiService
      and forces drivers to accept ride request/bookings only using MyTaxiService.
      During the registration process taxi drivers are asked to provide their personal and vehicle data and work time table.
      At the end of the registration process a unique code will be assigned to each taxi.
      Eventually, the city's local government provides each taxi a device. This device is used to see incoming ride requests or bookings
      and to signal their acceptance. In addition to this device, taxi drivers receive a gps system used by MyTaxiService to
      track their position

    2. Since MyTaxiService is aware of the work timetable of each taxi, taxies are considered unavailable
      if and only if they are serving a ride/booking request.  After a taxi has finished serving a passenger, he has to notify that
      to MyTaxiService so MyTaxiService will consider the taxi available again. Considering that MyTaxiService knows the position
      of each taxi and the destination of each ride there, there's no chance a taxi driver can cheat by not signaling he hasn't completed a ride yet.

    3. A Taxi might have an accident, if that happens, the taxi driver can report it and therefore
      can be considered unavailable

    4. Once a user sends a ride request, he or she cannot change any detail of the request nor can
        undo the request.

    5. MyTaxiService is aware of the characteristics of each taxies (number of passengers)

    6. MyTaxiService is aware of all the possible valid location in the city, so the user is forced to select one of them and not insert one of them.

    7. Taxi can accept only ride request/booking within the city borders.

    8. Accepting a ride/booking request by the taxi driver: signaling that the taxi has already left in order to pick a registered user up.

    9. Visitor: A generic person that is not registered to the service.

  Terms and definitions

        of the application that manage the interaction with the user and the logic behind
        this interaction
      - MyTaxiService(B) : The back end of MyTaxiService, that is to say, the components
        of the application that manage the forwarding of the ride / booking request with all
        their associated notifications, the search of available taxies compatible with the request/booking inserted, and other internal
        tasks not exposed to the user or the taxies

    Actors
      - Visitor
          A user can only see the login page and complete the registration(which is mandatory to use the service)
          to be able to access to all the functionality of the application.

      - Registered User
          A registered user can, after a successful login, access all the functionality of the application: it can
          request/reserve a taxi ride, view the status of older bookings and cancel a already confirmed taxi booking.

      - Taxi driver
          A taxi driver, after a successful login, is granted to: being notified by the system of an incoming request,
          notify the system about the conclusion of a taxi ride.

      - MyTaxiService(B)
          This actor represents the back-end part of the MyTaxiService software system as described in the "Terms and definition section"
