1) INTRODUCTION
  1.1) Purpose
    This document represent the Requirement Analysis and Specification Document
    (RASD). The main goal of this document is to completely describe the system
    in terms of functional and non-functional requirements, to show the constraints and the limit
    of the software and simulate the typical use cases that will occur after the
    development. This document is intended to all developer and programmer who
    have to implement the requirements, to system analyst who want to integrate
    other system with this one, and could be used as a contractual basis between
    the customer and the developer.

  1.2) Scope of the project
    The aim of this project is to develop myTaxiService, a web/mobile application that makes easier and quicker taking taxies.
    Thanks to MyTaxiService, anyone can request or book a taxi and get realtime information
    about how long it will take to be picked up or about taxi's current position and code.
    In addition, MyTaxiService provides an efficient way to allocate taxies by dividing the
    city in zones and using a queue based allocation system, in order to reduce the
    waiting time and city's traffic.

    1.3) Goals
      In this subsection we describe a set of high level goals that myTaxiService is proposed to achieve.

      1. Simplify and speed up the process of taking a taxi
        1.1 When a user has entered his taxi ride details and clicks or taps
        the request button, then MyTaxiService will find the first
        available taxi that fits for the inserted ride details, booking it to the user

      1.2 When a user has entered his taxi reservation details and clicks or taps
        the book button, then MyTaxiService will book a taxi that fits for the
        inserted booking details and for the indicated meeting time

      2. Guarantee an efficient and fair management of taxi queues
        2.2 Guarantee a right distribution of taxies in the city

        2.3 Guarantee short taxi availability times and short waiting times

      PRELIMINARY ASSUMPTIONS
    ASSUMPTIONS
      1. MyTaxiService has been commissioned by the city local government.
        Each taxi in the city must have a taxi licence provided by the local government. This licence requires the registration to the myTaxiService
        and forces drivers to accept ride request/reservations only using MyTaxiService.
        During the registration process taxi drivers are asked to provide their personal and vehicle and work time table.
        At the end of the registration process each taxi will be provided an unique code.
        The city's local government provides each taxi with a device used to see incoming ride requests or reservations and
        to signal the acceptance of these ones, along with a gps device used to track the taxi's position.

        2. MyTaxiService is aware of the work time table of each taxi, so there's no need to consider
        the case in which a taxi has no pending requests but is not available: taxies are unavailable
        if and only if they are serving a ride/reservation request; an exception to this case is that a taxi could have an accident.  After a taxi has finished serving a passenger he has to notify that
        to myTaxiService and so myTaxiService will consider the taxi available again. Considering that myTaxiService knows the position
        of the taxi and the destination of each ride there is no chance a taxi drive can cheat by not signalling he hasn't yet finished service a passenger.

        3. Once a user sends a ride request, he or she cannot change any detail of the request nor can
          undo the request.

        4. MyTaxiService is aware of the characteristics of each taxies (number of passengers)

        5. MyTaxiService is aware of all the possible valid location in the city, so the user is forced to select one of them and not insert one of them.

        6. Taxi can accept only ride reservation/request within the city borders.

        7. Accepting a ride/reservation request by the taxi driver: signaling that the taxi has already left in order to pick a registered user up.

        8. Visitor: A generic person that is not registered to the service.
