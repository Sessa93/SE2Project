Scenarios/Use cases:

1) A passenger requests a taxi ride
  [Actors]: the requesting passenger, the myTaxiService(B) application
  [Pre-cons]: the passenger has access to the myTaxiService(F) application; the passenger
  has access to the web from the device used to access the application; the passenger is
  registered to myTaxiService as a passenger. The passenger wants to start the ride in less
  than two hours; The passenger is logged into the myTaxiService(F) application(web or mobile).
  [Post-cons]: the taxi will arrive at the requested location as punctual as possible with
  respect to the requested time
  [Entry Cnd]: the passenger is willing to take a taxi. the passenger
  [Exit Cnd]: the application acknowledges the passenger that a taxi is available and shows
  the waiting time for the taxi along with a button to undo the taxi ride request.
  [Exceptions]:
    - Connection lost: The mobile application immediately notifies the user.
  [Flow of events]:
    - The passenger hits the 'request ride' button
    - The passenger fills and sends the request ride form by inserting the starting location, the ending location,
    the time in which a taxi has to be ready and the number of passengers.
    - The myTaxiService(F) application acknowledges the passenger about its request by showing to him
    the time before a taxi will be available, and if a taxi is available, the taxi arrival time.
    If there are no taxi available then myTaxiService(F) will notify the passenger
  [Special Requirements]:
    - The user must be notified about the state of the request within 30 seconds from the submitting time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2) myTaxiService(B) forwards a received request to a driver
  [Actors]: a taxi driver, the myTaxiService(F) application
  [Pre-cons]: the taxi driver has access to the myTaxiService application; the taxi driver
  has access to the web from the device used to access the application; the taxi driver is
  registered to myTaxiService as a driver; the taxi driver owns and uses on his taxi
  a gps system provided by the myTaxiService service to respond to taxi ride
  requests; the taxi driver has signaled via the app that has finished serving a passenger and is
  ready for a new ride('Available' state)
  [Post-cons]: the taxi driver knows that a passenger has requested a ride with the specified
  details and has to accept it or not
  [Entry Cnd]: the myTaxService(F) has received a request for a ride from a passenger
  [Exit Cnd]: myTaxService(B) notifies the selected taxi driver
  [Exceptions]:
    - No taxi available: if the queue relative to taxi zone of the request is empty(no taxi available)
    then the myTaxiService(B) uses the queue of one of the zones adjacent to the one we're considering
    - No ack from the selected driver's app: the system repeats the forwarding of the request
  [Flow of Events]:
    - the myTaxiService(B) receives a ride request, calculates the taxi zone of the starting point of the ride
      and extracts a taxi (using a FIFO logic) from the queue of taxies associated with the taxi zone and forwards to that taxi the ride request.
    - the myTaxiService(B) notifies the selected taxi's driver of a new ride request along with all the details relative to it.


    {Here we model just the fact that a ride request is forwarded to a taxi driver and that that taxi driver
    receives it with success}
    {We'll use another scenario to model the fact that a taxi driver that has received a ride request
    accepts or not that request}
    {When a taxi driver signals it has finished a ride(and this is mandatory) then we consider the
    taxi available for a new ride}
    {When a taxi driver receives a ride request he has only to signal the fact that is reaching the passenger
    , it cannot decline a ride request, if the taxi driver does not signal is reaching the passenger
    within a certain time than the systems uses another taxi and signals what happened to the admins}

  Flow of Events:
    - The mobile app access automatically to the GPS system, retrieves the current position, and sends the data to the System
    - The System receives the positioning data, calculates the zone, stores the taxi ID in the queue associated to the calculated zone
      and recalculates the distribution of taxies over the zones.
    - The System acknowledges the driver.
  Special Requirements:
    - The system must notifies the driver within 1min from the submitting time }
