INTRODUCTION
  Purpose
    This document represent the Requirement Analysis and Specification Document
    (RASD). The main goal of this document is to completely describe the system
    in terms of functional and non-functional requirements, to show the constraints and the limit
    of the software and simulate the typical use cases that will occur after the
    development. This document is intended to all developers and programmers who
    have to implement the requirements, to system analysts who want to integrate
    other systems with this one, and could be used as a contractual basis between
    the customer and the developer.

  Scope of the project
    The aim of this project is to develop MyTaxiService, a web/mobile application that makes easier and quicker taking taxies
    within the city's borders.
    Thanks to MyTaxiService, anyone can request or book a taxi and get realtime information
    about how long it will take to be picked up or about the taxi's current position and identification
    code.
    In addition to that, MyTaxiService provides an efficient way to allocate taxies by dividing the
    city in zones and using a queue based allocation system, in order to reduce the average
    waiting time and city's traffic.

  Goals

    1. Simplify and speed up the process of taking a taxi within the city's borders

      1.1 When a registered user has entered his taxi ride details and clicks or taps
      the "REQUEST TAXI" button, MyTaxiService will find the first
      available mtaxi that fits for the inserted ride details, and this mtaxi will
      pick up the registered user as soon as possible

      1.2 When a registered user has entered his booking details and clicks or taps
        the "BOOK TAXI" button, MyTaxiService will book a mtaxi that fits for the
        inserted booking details and for the indicated pick up time

    2. Guarantee an efficient and fair management of taxi queues

      2.2 Guarantee a balanced distribution of mtaxies in the city, in order
      to have them always available for different city zones

      2.3 Guarantee short mtaxi availability times and short waiting times

      --
  Assumptions
    1. MyTaxiService has been commissioned by the city's local government.

    2. The local government provides each mtaxi with a device similar to a small navigator(MYT). This device is used
      to: see and accept ride/booking requests, see zone change orders, report accidents; it has a built in gps module through which MyTaxiService can
      track the position of the mtaxi on which is mounted

    3. Mtaxies can only serve ride/booking requests forwarded by MyTaxiService(B)

    4. Mtaxies operate only whithin the city's borders

SCENARIOS, USE CASES AND UML MODELS

    Scenarios
    1. Bob is a product manager with a very busy schedule. At 11.00 he has a meeting
       with a group of clients to discuss about the features of a new product.
       This meeting is located in a another part of the city.
       For his shifts Bob usually takes taxies, and, in order to speed up this process, he
       started using MyTaxiService.
       It's 10:30 and Bob decides to take a taxi via MyTaxiService. He opens the app,
       the app remembers his credentials and logs him in.
       Bob inserts the address of the meeting and of his current location, choses one passenger and taps
       the "REQUEST TAXI" button. MyTaxiService then alerts him that is finding a mtaxi.
       Near Bob's location, a mtaxi has finished serving a passenger, so MyTaxiService(B) signals to it
       Bob's request. Charlene, the driver of the mtaxi, despite the fact that it's still work time, she wants to take a coffee
       and so ignores the request. After 5 mins MyTaxiService(B) tries to find a new mtaxi
       for Bob: Albert's mtaxi is available and MyTaxiService(B) forwards Bob's request to it.
       Albert receives the request and alerts MyTaxiService(B) that he's going to take care of the ride.
       MyTaxiService alerts Bob that his taxi will arrive in 3 mins.
       The Taxi arrives, and in 10 mins Bob reaches the meeting place. MyTaxiService(B)
       signals the behavior of Charlene to her supervisors, and, after a few weeks, Charlene receives a warning and a fine of 200€

    2. It's Friday, 10 a.m, Paris, Ann, a young american tourist, has to take a flight at 12 a.m to return to New York City.
        Ann has carefully planned the return trip, infact
       yesterday she made a taxi booking via MyTaxiService web site for 9:45 a.m , but the mtaxi has not arrived yet.
       So she take her smartphone opens the MyTaxiService application, enters her credentials and after a successful login
       she discovers that her mtaxi is stuck in a terrible traffic jam and that MyTaxiService is trying to find a new mtaxi.
       "I'll miss my flight!" she thinks, and starts to wait with the heart full of hope

    3. Dave, an experienced taxi driver of the city, has received, through MyTaxiService, a request for a ride
       from a passenger. "It's not too much far from where i am now", he thinks, "It'll be easy", and notifies
       MyTaxiService that he'll take care of the request. He starts driving toward the passenger's position, but suddenly
       , while he's crossing a very busy crossroad,
       a reckless driver coming from the left crosses at high speed the crossroad and hits with violence
       Dave's taxi cab. Luckily nobody gets hurt, but Dave's taxi cabe has been seriously damaged.
       Dave cannot fulfill the passenger's request so he takes his smartphone, opens the MyTaxiService app,
       and taps the "REPORT ACCIDENT" button, he accesses a screen where he inserts the accident details and taps the "SUBMIT" button.
       MyTaxiService(B) receives the Dave's report and after some computations selects and notifies another driver to fulfill the passenger request.

    4.Ann, a young female student from Texas, is visiting Italy with his boyfriend Bob.
      It's Friday morning, they are walking on the streets of Milan and they're thinking
      about visiting the Expo on Saturday. Ann proposes to use a taxi to reach Expo's location and
      Bob agrees. Ann is a very cautious person so she thinks it's better to book a taxi, for this
      reason she searches on Google "taxi milano book" and discovers MyTaxiService.
      She downloads the app on her Iphone; she opens the app, which displays a login screen with
      a registration button, and taps that button being so redirected to a registration screen; she inserts
      her mail address, choses and confirm a password, accepts the legal
      terms of the app and taps the confirm button; after that Ann is ready to use the app.
      In order to book a taxi for Saturday for the Expo, Ann accesses the booking section of the app,
      taps the "ADD BOOKING" button and in the add booking screen inserts the Expo's location by selecting the right item in a dropdown menu, inserts the time and location of the picking
      , choses two passengers and taps the big "BOOK TAXI" button, MyTaxiService responds by alerting Ann that her booking
      has been processed successfully. Ann is happy about the fact that everything has proceeded without problems.
      Bob instead is not so happy because he thinks that the Milan's transportation system is perfect
      to reach Expo and its far way cheaper than taking a taxi. Bob and Ann have a brief discussion
      about this and, at the end, Ann agrees with Bob. Given that, Ann tries to undo the booking:
      she opens the app, she logs in, she accesses the booking section and there she sees her booking for Saturday, she taps
      the bin icon to delete the booking, she confirms her intention to do that and everything is done.

    5.It's Thursday, 14:00 and George, a young mtaxi driver, is driving in the city's center.
       He noticed many of his colleagues waiting for requests in their cabs.
       Meanwhile MyTaxiService(B), by making some analysis on the mtaxies' GPS data, realizes that there are too many mtaxies
       in the city's center in relation with the number of ride requests for that zone. The system also indentifies
       some zones of the city where the concentration of taxies is too low. According to a policy based on some statistical data
       MyTaxiService(B) decides to move 10 mtaxies, including the George's one, from the city's center to the city's zones mentioned above.
       As a consequence of that, George receives by MyTaxiService a notification that alerts him to move to zone C (one of the city's zones
       with low concentration of mtaxies). George start driving towards zone C and continues his work.
