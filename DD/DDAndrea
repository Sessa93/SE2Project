1) Introduction

  - Purpose
    This document represent the Desing Document(DD)
    The purpose of the Design Document is to provide a medium/base level description of the design of MyTaxiService
    in order to allow for software development to proceed with an understanding of what is to be
    built and how it is expected to built.
    The main goal of this document is to completely describe the system-to-be by:
      - Detecting high-level components of the software to be
      - Describing how these components communicates and interact with each other
      - Describing how software components are distributed on the architecture's tiers
      - Motivating and describing the adopted architecture style

  - Scope
    The aim of this project is to develop MyTaxiService, a web/mobile application that
    makes easier and quicker taking taxies within the city’s borders. Thanks to MyTaxiService,
    anyone can request or book a taxi and get realtime information about how long
    it will take to be picked up or about the taxi’s current position and identification code.
    In addition to that, MyTaxiService provides an efficient way to allocate taxies by dividing
    the city in zones and using a queue based allocation system, in order to reduce the
    average waiting time and city’s traffic.
    This Software Design is focused on the base level system and critical parts
    of the system.

2 - Architectural Design

  - Overview
      The architectural design section is divided into two main parts:
        - Software components description and interaction
          In this sub section is provided a detailed description of the main components of the software system.
          Further the attention is focused on the interaction of the various components, also providing a high level description
          of such interfaces. To exemplify the above mentioned description a set of UML diagrams(Component, Deployment, Sequence diagrams) is
          included.
        - Architectural styles and patterns
          This second section illustrates the chosen architectural style providing a schematic diagram and a
          detailed description and motivation of the architectural choices.

  - High level components and their interactions
      Controller Components:
        - Request Dispatcher:
            This component provides the functionality of dispatching messages from MyTaxiService(B) to a generic
            mtaxi driver. This notification includes pick up requests and general alert messages.

        - Request Manager:
            This component is in charge of managing all types of requests coming from the Requests Receiver.
            Other requests could also come from the Queue manager in case if the distribution of mtaxies over the zones is needed.
            In case of a simple ride request the module interacts with the queue manager to get an available
            mtaxi driver, after that through the interaction with the Dispatcher component the selected driver is
            informed of the ride request.
            In case of a booking ride request the component stores the request in the DB through the Data Manager component.
            Ten  minutes before the booking time the Request manager selects a valid mtaxi driver through the Queue manager
            and notifies the selected driver via the Dispatcher component.
            In case of zone change order request coming from the Queue manager a message is forwarded to all the mtaxies
            subscribed to the interested zone, the message includes the identificators of the mtaxies that are subjected to
            the change zone order.
            Finally this component also manages the state of each mtaxi driver accordingly with the work time table(provided at the moment of the driver registration
            and stored in the database system) and eventual notifications of accident.

        - External Communication manager:
            This component is in charge of the interaction of MyTaxiService(B) with external services such as
            the traffic information service or the mtaxi GPS data and permits other components to access the corresponding information.


        - Location Manager
            This component manages the GPS data provided by the External Communication manager.
            The component operates in order to provide to the Queue manager GPS data in suitable form.

        - Queue Manager:
            This component is in charge of managing the distribution of mtaxies in the city's zone.
            The MTaxi manager assigns to each zone a queue(manged with the usual FIFO policy).
            Taking into account some historical data(last day), date and time and traffic information the MTaxi manager can
            decide to move some mtaxies from one zone to another. The change zone order is sent to the selected mtaxi drivers
            by invoking services of the request manager.

        - Request Receiver:
            This component represents an input communication layer that manages incoming messages from users and mtaxies.
            According to the type of message, the request receiver will properly invoke services provided by the request manager
            using different interfaces.

      Model Components
        - Data Manager:
            This component is in charge of managing all accesses to the database system. It works as a sort of
            intermediate layer between the application logic and the database system.
            It offers the functionalities of user/driver registration and information access/updating.

      View Components:
        - MyTaxiServiceAppUserUI:
            This component is in charge of managing the interaction with MyTaxiService of a generic user via the mobile application
        - MyTaxiServiceAppDriverUI:
            This component is in charge of managing the interaction with MyTaxiService of a generic mtaxi driver via the MYT device
        - MyTaxiServiceWebUserUI:
            This component is in charge of managing the interaction with MyTaxiService of a generic user via the web site version of MyTaxiService

    - Components Interfaces

    - Architecture Styles Description
      Some general considerations on the domain of the environment:
        - The number of available mtaxies within the city could be very high(ie a thousand of mtaxies).
        - The number of requests by active users could also be very high typically in the order of the available mtaxies.
      Due to those simple considerations the chosen architecture style is a mix of two well known styles:
        - 3 tiers Client/Server architecture
        - Event Based architecture(Publisher/Subscriber)
      The Client/Server architectures is used to manage all types of critical requests(booking/ride requests, login, registration and ) coming from the users of MyTaxiService(drivers and passenger).
      Such an architecture introduce a sort of synchronization between the central system and the clients of the system.
      This synchronization guarantees to the clients that all requests are correctly received and stored by the central system.
      Also due to the possible high number of requests coming from users this particular style reveals to be very scalable
      and reliable.
      The event base architecture is used for non critical communications i.e. zone specific alert messages or change zone orders
      forwarded to a specific subset of mtaxies present in a particular zone.
      In this case the event based style is suitable because all messages forwarded to mtaxies driver have two characteristics:
        - Do not need any reply(asynchronous)
        - Usually involve a high number of mtaxies

      In particular each "topic" of the publisher corresponds to a particular city zone, all the mtaxies present in the zone
      are automatically subscribed to the corresponding topic. Events are generated internally in the central system, change zone event
      are produced by the Queue manager component, while eventual zone specific alert are generated by the Request manager in case problems
      are detected in a particular zone.
      The client/server styles, as stated above, is a typical 3-tier architecture composed by:
        - One web server hosting the web ui interface of MyTaxiService
        - One or more application server(in order to guarantee the availabilty/relaiabilty of the system) hosting
          the core logic of MyTaxiService, this tier also includes the servers needed to implements the Event Based styles
        - A distributed database system to store the informations related to users and mtaxi drivers.

      Follows a schematic diagram of the architecture:
      TODO GIORGIO

      As already mentioned above the central system makes use of external service regarding the traffic information in the
      city. It could be assumed that information are distributed to MyTaxiService via a SOA architecture because this is
      the most suitable(and most used) way to distribute data and services to external companies.
