1) Introduction

  - Purpose
    This document represent the Desing Document(DD)
    The purpose of the Design Document is to provide a medium/base level description of the design of MyTaxiService
    in order to allow for software development to proceed with an understanding of what is to be
    built and how it is expected to built.
    The main goal of this document is to completely describe the system-to-be by:
      - Detecting high-level components of the software to be
      - Describing how these components communicates and interact with each other
      - Describing how software components are distributed on the architecture's tiers
      - Motivating and describing the adopted architecture style

  - Scope
    The aim of this project is to develop MyTaxiService, a web/mobile application that
    makes easier and quicker taking taxies within the city’s borders. Thanks to MyTaxiService,
    anyone can request or book a taxi and get realtime information about how long
    it will take to be picked up or about the taxi’s current position and identification code.
    In addition to that, MyTaxiService provides an efficient way to allocate taxies by dividing
    the city in zones and using a queue based allocation system, in order to reduce the
    average waiting time and city’s traffic.
    This Software Design is focused on the base level system and critical parts
    of the system.

  - Document Structure
    - Introduction
      This section provides a general description of the Design Document by clearly stating purpose an aim of the project.
      It also include a disambiguation section to help the reader in the process of resolving the ambiguity generate by
      the use of natural language

    - Architecture Design
      The first part of this section provides a detailed description of the high-level components of MyTaxiService and of how
      these components interact.
      The second part introduces the architecture style chosen for MyTaxiService. The focus is on motivation, advantages and possible
      disadvantages of chosen architecture.

    - Algorithms Design
      The section aims to provide a very low-level description of some routine functionalities of MyTaxiService.
      Some code(Javascript???!!) is included

    - User Interface Design
      In this section are provided some mockups describing some base level requirements of the user interface to-be

    - Requirements Traceability
      This section provides a matrix of traceability that allows the reader to map functional requirements on the
      previously defined software components

2 - Architectural Design

  - Overview
      The architectural design section is divided into two main parts:
        - Software components description and interaction
          In this sub section is provided a detailed description of the main components of the software system.
          Further the attention is focused on the interaction of the various components, also providing a high level description
          of such interfaces. To exemplify the above mentioned description a set of UML diagrams(Component, Deployment, Sequence diagrams) is
          included.
        - Architectural styles and patterns
          This second section illustrates the chosen architectural style providing a schematic diagram and a
          detailed description and motivation of the architectural choices.

  - High level components and their interactions
      Controller Components:
        - Dispatcher:
            This component provides the functionality of dispatching messages from MyTaxiService(B) to a generic
            mtaxi driver. This notification includes pick up requests and general alert messages.

        - Request Manager:
            This component is in charge of managing ride/booking request coming from the API manager.
            In case of a simple ride request the module interacts with the queue manager to get an available
            mtaxi driver, after that through the interaction with the Dispatcher component the selected driver is
            informed of the ride request
            In case of a booking ride request the component stores the request in the DB through the Data Manager component.
            Ten  minutes before the booking time the Request manager selects a valid mtaxi driver through the Queue manager
            and notifies the selected driver via the Dispatcher component.

        - External Communication manager:
            This component is in charge of the interaction of MyTaxiService(B) with external services such as
            the traffic information service and permits other components to use the corresponding information.

        - Queue Manager:
            This component is in charge of managing the distribution of mtaxies in the city's zone.
            The MTaxi manager assigns to each zone a queue(manged with the usual FIFO policy).
            Taking into account some historical data(last day), date and time and traffic information the MTaxi manager can
            decide to move some mtaxies from one zone to another. The change zone order is sent to the selected mtaxi drivers
            via the Dispatcher component.

        - Driver State Manager
            This component manages the state of each mtaxi driver accordingly with the work time table(provided at the moment of the driver registration)
            and eventual notifications of accident.

        - Request Receiver:
            This component provides the functionality of invoking the correct component according to type of message received.
            If the sender message of the message is a non-driver user of MyTaxiService then the API manager will interact with
            the Request Manager. Else if the sender is a mtaxi driver then Driver State Manager is invoked to take care of the notification.
            Otherwise if the message regards a user/taxi driver registration the Data Manger is invoked to store the new data in the database.

      Model Components
        - Data Manager:
            This component is in charge of managing all accesses to the database system. It works as a sort of
            intermediate layer between the application logic and the database system.
            It offers the functionalities of user/driver registration and information access/updating.

      View Components:
        - MyTaxiServiceAppUserUI:
            This component is in charge of managing the interaction with MyTaxiService of a generic user
        - MyTaxiServiceAppDriverUI:
            This component is in charge of managing the interaction with MyTaxiService of a generic mtaxi driver
