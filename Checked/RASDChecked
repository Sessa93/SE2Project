INTRODUCTION
  Purpose
    This document represent the Requirement Analysis and Specification Document
    (RASD). The main goal of this document is to completely describe the system
    in terms of functional and non-functional requirements, to show the constraints and the limit
    of the software and simulate the typical use cases that will occur after the
    development. This document is intended to all developer and programmer who
    have to implement the requirements, to system analyst who want to integrate
    other system with this one, and could be used as a contractual basis between
    the customer and the developer.

  Scope of the project
    The aim of this project is to develop MyTaxiService, a web/mobile application that makes easier and quicker taking taxies.
    Thanks to MyTaxiService, anyone can request or book a taxi and get realtime information
    about how long it will take to be picked up or about taxi's current position and code.
    In addition, MyTaxiService provides an efficient way to allocate taxies by dividing the
    city in zones and using a queue based allocation system, in order to reduce the
    waiting time and city's traffic.

  Goals
    In this subsection we describe a set of high level goals that MyTaxiService is proposed to achieve.

    1. Simplify and speed up the process of taking a taxi

      1.1 When a registered user has entered his taxi ride details and clicks or taps
      the "REQUEST TAXI" button, MyTaxiService will find the first
      available taxi that fits for the inserted ride details, and this taxi will
      pick up the user as soon as possible

      1.2 When a registered user has entered his booking details and clicks or taps
        the "BOOK TAXI" button, MyTaxiService will book a taxi that fits for the
        inserted booking details and for the indicated pick up time

    2. Guarantee an efficient and fair management of taxi queues

      2.2 Guarantee a balanced distribution of taxies in the city, in order
      to have always taxies available for different city zones

      2.3 Guarantee short taxi availability times and short waiting times

  Assumptions
    1. MyTaxiService has been commissioned by the city local government.
      Taxi drivers that work in the city can join MyTaxiService via a registration to be
      done in the local government public transport office.
      During this registration process taxi drivers are asked to provide their personal and vehicle data along with their work timetable.
      After that taxi drivers receive a unique code that identifies their taxi cab in relation to MyTaxiService.
      To make MyTaxiService functional, the local government provides each mtaxi with a device similar to a small navigator(MYT), which is used
      to see incoming ride requests or bookings and to signal their acceptance; this device has a built in gps module through which MyTaxiService can
      track their position

    2. Since MyTaxiService is aware of the work timetable of each mtaxi, mtaxies are considered unavailable
      if and only if they are serving a ride/booking request.  After a mtaxi has finished serving a passenger, its driver has to notify
      MyTaxiService(B) of the event, so MyTaxiService(B) will consider the mtaxi available again.
      Considering that MyTaxiService(B) knows the position of each mtaxi and the destination of each ride, there's no chance a mtaxi driver
      can cheat by not signaling he hasn't completed a ride yet.

    3. A mtaxi might have an accident, if that happens, its driver can report it and therefore
       be considered unavailable

    4. Once a registered user sends a ride request, he or she cannot change any detail of the request nor can
        undo the request(FR)

    5. MyTaxiService(B) is aware of the characteristics of each mtaxies (number of passengers, unique code)

    6. MyTaxiService(B) is aware of all the possible valid location in the city, so a registered user that wants to request a ride or a booking is forced to select one among them.

    7. Mtaxies can accept only ride request/booking within the city borders

    8. Mtaxies can only serve only ride/booking requests forwarded by MyTaxiService(B)

    9. Using gps data from the mtaxies and public traffic data, MyTaxyService(B) can balance the assigment
    of the request so that  .... (RF)
