1) Introduction

  - Purpose
    This document represents the Design Document(DD).
    The purpose of the Design Document is to provide a medium/base level description of the design of MyTaxiService
    in order to allow for software developers to proceed with an understanding of what is to be
    built and how it is expected to be built.
    The main goal of this document is to completely describe the system-to-be by:
      - Detecting high-level components of the software to be
      - Describing how these components communicate and interact with each other
      - Describing how software components are distributed on the architecture's tiers
      - Motivating and describing the adopted architectural style

  - Scope
    The aim of this project is to develop MyTaxiService, a web/mobile application that
    makes easier and quicker taking taxies within the city’s borders. Thanks to MyTaxiService,
    anyone can request or book a taxi and get realtime information about how long
    it will take to be picked up or about the taxi’s current position and identification code.
    In addition to that, MyTaxiService provides an efficient way to allocate taxies by dividing
    the city in zones and using a queue based allocation system, in order to reduce the
    average waiting time and city’s traffic.
    This Software Design is focused on the base level system and critical parts
    of the system.

2 - Architectural Design

  - Overview
      The architectural design section is divided into two main parts:
        - Software components description and interaction
            In this section is provided a detailed description of the main components of the software system
            and of their interactions.
            To exemplify the above mentioned description a set of UML diagrams(Component, Deployment, Sequence diagrams) is
            included.
        - Architectural styles and patterns
            In this section the software system architecture is illustrated using a schematic diagram.
            In addition to that all the architectural choices, patterns and styles considered are motivated and described.

  - High level components and their interactions
      Controller Components:
        - Dispatcher:
            This component provides the functionality of dispatching messages from MyTaxiService(B) to users and mtaxies.
            Examples of these messages are :
            - for users : aproximate waiting time for being picked up, the requested mtaxi's identification code
            - for mtaxies : zone change order, new ride request

        - Request Manager:
            This component is in charge of:
            - managing all types of requests coming from the Requests Receiver(this requires an
            interaction with the User Messages Dispatcher, the Taxi Messages Dispatcher, the Queue Manager, the
            Location Manager and the Data Manager)
            - managing a situation of non fair distribution of mtaxies in the city's zones(this requires an interaction
            with the Queue Manager)

        - External Communication manager:
            This component is in charge of the interaction of MyTaxiService(B) with external services such as
            the traffic information service or the mtaxies GPS data and allows other components to access these pieces of information.


        - Location Manager
            This component requests and digests data from the External Communication Manager; the Location Manager
            provides also services that elaborate these data and make them accessible by other components

        - Queue Manager:
            This component is in charge of:
            - distributing available mtaxies in city's zones and organize them in zone per zone queues
            - checking periodically if the distribution of mtaxies in city's zones is fair and computing the mtaxies
            that need to be moved to other zones

        - Request Receiver:
            This component manages incoming messages from users and mtaxies.
            According to the type of message, the request receiver will properly invoke services provided by the Request Manager.

      Model Components
        - Data Manager:
            This component is in charge of managing all accesses to the database system. It works as a sort of
            intermediate layer between the application logic and the database system

      View Components:
        - MyTaxiServiceAppUserGUI:
            This component manages the direct interaction between a user and MyTaxiService via the MyTaxiService mobile app GUI
        - MyTaxiServiceAppDriverGUI:
            This component manages the direct interaction between a mtaxi driver and MyTaxiService via the MYT device GUI
        - MyTaxiServiceWebUserGUI:
            This component manages the direct interaction between a user and a taxi driver and MyTaxiService via the MyTaxiService web app GUI

        For each of these view components a communication manager is associated: this component manages the dispatching of requests to MyTaxiService(b)
        and the response messages from MyTaxiService(b)

    - Components Interfaces

    - Architecture Styles Description
      Some general considerations on the domain of the environment:
        - The number of available mtaxies within the city could be very high(i.e a thousand of mtaxies)
        - The number of requests by active users could also be very high typically in the order of the available mtaxies.
      Due to those simple considerations the chosen architectural style is a mix of two well known styles:
        - 3 tiers Client/Server architecture
        - Event Based architecture(Publisher/Subscriber)
      The Client/Server architectures is used to manage all types of critical requests(booking/ride requests, login, registration and ) coming from the users of MyTaxiService(drivers and passenger).
      Such an architecture introduce a sort of synchronization between the central system and the clients of the system.
      This synchronization guarantees to the clients that all requests are correctly received and stored by the central system.
      Also due to the possible high number of requests coming from users this particular style reveals to be very scalable
      and reliable.
      The event base architecture is used for non critical communications i.e. zone specific alert messages or change zone orders
      forwarded to a specific subset of mtaxies present in a particular zone.
      In this case the event based style is suitable because all messages forwarded to mtaxies driver have two characteristics:
        - Do not need any reply(asynchronous)
        - Usually involve a high number of mtaxies

      In particular each "topic" of the publisher corresponds to a particular city zone, all the mtaxies present in the zone
      are automatically subscribed to the corresponding topic. Events are generated internally in the central system, change zone event
      are produced by the Queue manager component, while eventual zone specific alert are generated by the Request manager in case problems
      are detected in a particular zone.
      The client/server styles, as stated above, is a typical 3-tier architecture composed by:
        - One web server hosting the web ui interface of MyTaxiService
        - One or more application server(in order to guarantee the availabilty/relaiabilty of the system) hosting
          the core logic of MyTaxiService, this tier also includes the servers needed to implements the Event Based styles
        - A distributed database system to store the informations related to users and mtaxi drivers.

      Follows a schematic diagram of the architecture:
      TODO GIORGIO

      As already mentioned above the central system makes use of external service regarding the traffic information in the
      city. It could be assumed that information are distributed to MyTaxiService via a SOA architecture because this is
      the most suitable(and most used) way to distribute data and services to external companies.
