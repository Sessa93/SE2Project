\section{Introduction}
  \subsection{Purpose}
    The main purpose of this document is to analyze effort and cost for MyTaxiService.
    The analysis is performed using two different models:
    \begin{itemize}
     \item Function Points: to determine the size and the overall complexity of the project
     \item COCOMO II: to determine the effort and cost of the project
    \end{itemize}
    In the final part of the document are also included a Gantt diagram to visualize the page
    general schedule of the project and a resource allocation diagram to show how the team 
    members have been assigned to the various tasks.

\section{Function Point Analysis}
  \subsection{Introduction}
    The function point analysis is a technique that provides an algorithmic and statistical estimation of the size of a software project.\newline
    This estimation is based on the following elements of the product model:
    \begin{itemize}
     \item \textbf{Internal Logic Files:} It represents a homogeneous set of data managed and created by the application
     \item \textbf{External Logic Files:} It represents a homogeneous set of data used by the application but generated and maintained by other applications
     \item \textbf{External Input:} It represents a set of elementary procedures to elaborate data coming from the external environment
     \item \textbf{External Output:} It represents a set of procedures that generate data for the external environment with a significant elaboration of logic files
     \item \textbf{External Inquiry:} It represents a set of input/output operations that do not require a significant elaboration of logic files
    \end{itemize}
    The following table shows the coefficients to be used in the UFP computations and relative to the different function types and their estimated complexity:\newline

   \subsection{External Logic Files}

\section{COCOMO II Analysis}
  \subsection{Introduction}
    COCOMO II is algorithmic and statistical methodology used to estimate the effort of a software project.
    This estimation requires, as input data, the project size(SLOCs) and the project's scale and cost drivers coefficients.\newline
    
    \begin{itemize}
     \item \textbf{Cost Drivers:} COCOMO II has 17 cost drivers, which represent factors that contribute in significant way to the effort required to complete the software project
     \item \textbf{Scale Drivers:} COCOMO II has 5 scale driver which represent process specific factors that contribute in significant way to the effort required to complete the software project
    \end{itemize}
    
    In this case the previous Function Points analysis is used to estimate the SLOC number.\newline
    Assuming that the programming language used for the will be Java EE, the conversion factor between the 
    total function point counts(UFP) and the SLOC is 46.
    \begin{equation}
     SLOCs = conversionFactor * UFP = 113 * 46 = 5198
    \end{equation}

    The COCOMO II methodology estimates the effort needed to complete a software project via following equation:
    \begin{equation}
     effort = 2.94 * EAF * (KSLOC)^E
    \end{equation}
    where EAF(Effort Adjustment Factor) depends on the Cost Drivers and E is derived from the Scale Drivers.\newline
    COCOMO II estimates also the duration of a software project via following equation:
    \begin{equation}
     duration = 3.67 * (effort)^E
    \end{equation}
  \newpage
  \subsection{Analysis}
    In this section is included the final COCOMO analysis performed using a tool available at:\newline

 For the following tasks we assume that the implementation phase is divided into two main development activities(Backend and Frontend implementation).

 \item \textbf{T13:} Backend implementation - Duration: 2 months
 \item \textbf{T14:} Frontend implementation - Duration: 1.5 months
 \item \textbf{T15:} Acceptance Testing - Duration: 0.5 months

  \item Important changes to the project's requirements and design may occur.
	 \textbf{Probability:} Low\newline
	 \textbf{Effect:} Critical\newline

  \begin{enumerate}
   \item The organization is restructured, so that its to management changes\newline
