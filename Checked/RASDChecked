INTRODUCTION
  Purpose
    This document represent the Requirement Analysis and Specification Document
    (RASD). The main goal of this document is to completely describe the system
    in terms of functional and non-functional requirements, to show the constraints and the limit
    of the software and simulate the typical use cases that will occur after the
    development. This document is intended to all developer and programmer who
    have to implement the requirements, to system analyst who want to integrate
    other system with this one, and could be used as a contractual basis between
    the customer and the developer.

  Scope of the project
    The aim of this project is to develop MyTaxiService, a web/mobile application that makes easier and quicker taking taxies
    within the city's borders.
    Thanks to MyTaxiService, anyone can request or book a taxi and get realtime information
    about how long it will take to be picked up or about the taxi's current position and code.
    In addition to that, MyTaxiService provides an efficient way to allocate taxies by dividing the
    city in zones and using a queue based allocation system, in order to reduce the
    waiting time and city's traffic.

  Goals

    1. Simplify and speed up the process of taking a taxi within the city's borders

      1.1 When a registered user has entered his taxi ride details and clicks or taps
      the "REQUEST TAXI" button, MyTaxiService will find the first
      available mtaxi that fits for the inserted ride details, and this mtaxi will
      pick up the user as soon as possible

      1.2 When a registered user has entered his booking details and clicks or taps
        the "BOOK TAXI" button, MyTaxiService will book a mtaxi that fits for the
        inserted booking details and for the indicated pick up time

    2. Guarantee an efficient and fair management of taxi queues

      2.2 Guarantee a balanced distribution of mtaxies in the city, in order
      to have them always available for different city zones

      2.3 Guarantee short mtaxi availability times and short waiting times

  Assumptions
    1. MyTaxiService has been commissioned by the city's local government.
      Taxi drivers that work in the city can join MyTaxiService via a registration to be done using MytaxiService website.
      To make MyTaxiService functional, the local government provides each mtaxi with a device similar to a small navigator(MYT). This device is used
      to: see and accept ride/booking requests, see zone change orders, report accidents; it has a built in gps module through which MyTaxiService can
      track the position of the mtaxi's on which is mounted

    2. Since MyTaxiService is aware of the work timetable of each mtaxi, mtaxies are considered unavailable
      if and only if they are serving a ride/booking request. After a mtaxi has finished serving a passenger, its driver has to notify
      MyTaxiService(B) of the event, so MyTaxiService(B) will consider the mtaxi available again.
      Considering that MyTaxiService(B) knows the position of each mtaxi and the destination of each ride, there's no chance a mtaxi driver
      can cheat by not signaling he hasn't completed a ride yet.

    3. Mtaxies can only serve ride/booking requests forwarded by MyTaxiService(B)

    4. Mtaxies operate only whithin the city's borders
