\section{Introduction}
  \subsection{Purpose}
    The main purpose of this document is to analyze effort and cost for MyTaxiService.
    The analisys is performed using two different models:
    \begin{itemize}
     \item Function Points: to determine the size and the overall complexity of the project
     \item COCOMO II: to determine the effort and cost of the project
    \end{itemize}
    In the final part of the document are also included a Gantt diagram to visualize thepage
    general schedule of the project and a resource allocation diagram to show how the team 
    members have been assigned to the variuos tasks.

\section{Function Point Analisys}
  \subsection{Introduction}
    The function point approach is a tecnique that allows the project manager to extimate 
    the size of the project.\newline
    It is based on a combination of the project charateristics:
    \begin{itemize}
     \item \textbf{Internal Logic Files:} It represents a homogeneous set of data managed by the application
     \item \textbf{External Logic Files:} It represents a homogeneous set of data used by the application but generated and maintained by other applications
     \item \textbf{External Input:} It represents a set of elementary procedures to eleborate data coming from the external environment
     \item \textbf{External Output:} It represents a set of procedures that generates data for the external environment with a significant eleboration of data from logic files
     \item \textbf{External Inquiry:} It represents a set of input/output operation that do not require a significant eleaboration of logic data files.
    \end{itemize}
    The following table outline the number of Functional Point based on functionality and relative complexity:\newline

\section{COCOMO II Analisys}
  \subsection{Introduction}
    The COCOMO II calculations are based on estimates of a project's size in Source Lines of Code (SLOC).
    In this case the previous Function Points analysis is used to estimate the SLOC number.\newline
    Assuming that the programming language used for the will be Java EE, the conversion factor between the 
    total function point counts(UFP) and the SLOC is 46.
    \begin{equation}
     SLOCs = conversionFactor * UFP = 113 * 46 = 5198
    \end{equation}
    The SLOC number represents the entry point, the analysis proceeds by defining:
    \begin{itemize}
     \item \textbf{Cost Drivers:} COCOMO II has 17 cost drivers, i.e. multiplicative factors that determine the effort required to complete the software project
     \item \textbf{Scale Drivers:} COCOMO II has 5 scale driver that defines the most important factors to determine cost and duration of the project
    \end{itemize}
    The method defines the effort equation:
    \begin{equation}
     effor = 2.94 * EAF * (KSLOC)^E
    \end{equation}
    where EAF(Effort Adjustment Factor) depends on the Cost Drivers and E is derived from the Scale Driver.\newline
    The duration of the project is defined as:
    \begin{equation}
     duration = 3.67 * (effort)^E
    \end{equation}
