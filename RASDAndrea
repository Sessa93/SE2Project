1) INTRODUCTION
  1.1) Purpose
    This document represent the Requirement Analysis and Specification Document
    (RASD). The main goal of this document is to completely describe the system
    in terms of functional and non-functional requirements, to show the constraints and the limit
    of the software and simulate the typical use cases that will occur after the
    development. This document is intended to all developer and programmer who
    have to implement the requirements, to system analyst who want to integrate
    other system with this one, and could be used as a contractual basis between
    the customer and the developer.

  1.2) Scope of the project
    The aim of this project is to develop MyTaxiService, a web/mobile application that makes easier and quicker taking taxies.
    Thanks to MyTaxiService, anyone can request or book a taxi and get realtime information
    about how long it will take to be picked up or about taxi's current position and code.
    In addition, MyTaxiService provides an efficient way to allocate taxies by dividing the
    city in zones and using a queue based allocation system, in order to reduce the
    waiting time and city's traffic.

    1.3) Goals
      In this subsection we describe a set of high level goals that MyTaxiService is proposed to achieve.

      1. Simplify and speed up the process of taking a taxi
        1.1 When a user has entered his taxi ride details and clicks or taps
        the request button, then MyTaxiService will find the first
        available taxi that fits for the inserted ride details, booking it to the user

      1.2 When a user has entered his taxi reservation details and clicks or taps
        the book button, then MyTaxiService will book a taxi that fits for the
        inserted booking details and for the indicated meeting time

      2. Guarantee an efficient and fair management of taxi queues
        2.2 Guarantee a right distribution of taxies in the city

        2.3 Guarantee short taxi availability times and short waiting times

      PRELIMINARY ASSUMPTIONS
    ASSUMPTIONS
      1. MyTaxiService has been commissioned by the city local government.
        Each taxi in the city must have a taxi license provided by the local government. This license requires the registration to the MyTaxiService
        and forces drivers to accept ride request/reservations only using MyTaxiService.
        During the registration process taxi drivers are asked to provide their personal and vehicle data and work time table.
        At the end of the registration process a unique code will be assigned to each taxi.
        Eventually, the city's local government provides each taxi a device. This device is used to see incoming ride requests or reservations
        and to signal their acceptance

        2. Since MyTaxiService is aware of the work timetable of each taxi and GPS data, taxies are considered unavailable
        if and only if they are serving a ride/reservation request.  After a taxi has finished serving a passenger he has to notify that
        to MyTaxiService and so MyTaxiService will consider the taxi available again. Considering that MyTaxiService knows the position
        of the taxi and the destination of each ride there is no chance a taxi drive can cheat by not signalling he hasn't yet finished service a passenger.

        2.a A Taxi might have an accident, if that happens, the taxi driver can report it and so the taxi
        is considered unavailable.

        3. Once a user sends a ride request, he or she cannot change any detail of the request nor can
          undo the request.

        4. MyTaxiService is aware of the characteristics of each taxies (number of passengers)

        5. MyTaxiService is aware of all the possible valid location in the city, so the user is forced to select one of them and not insert one of them.

        6. Taxi can accept only ride reservation/request within the city borders.

        7. Accepting a ride/reservation request by the taxi driver: signaling that the taxi has already left in order to pick a registered user up.

        8. Visitor: A generic person that is not registered to the service.

        9. Exists an unique application(MyTaxiService(F)) both for taxi driver and normal user, MyTaxiService(F) give access to the proper set of functionalities
        according to the login credentials.

        10. Exists an unique application(MyTaxiService(F)) both for taxi driver and normal user, MyTaxiService(F) give access to the proper set of functionalities
        according to the login credentials.

3)Scenarios + UML Diagrams
    3.1) Scenarios identification
        1)Bob is a product manager with a very busy schedule. At 11.00 he has a meeting
          with a group of clients to discuss about the features of a new product.
          This meeting is located in a another part of the city.
          For his shifts Bob usually takes taxies, and, in order to speed up this process, he
          started using MyTaxiService.
          Its 10:30 and Bob decides to take a taxi via MyTaxiService. He opens the app,
          the app remembers his credentials and logs him in.
          Bob inserts the address of the meeting and of his current location, choses one passenger and taps
          the big request button. MyTaxiService then alerts him that is finding a taxi.
          Near Bob's location, a mtaxi has finished serving a passenger, so MyTaxiService(B) signals to it
          Bob's request. Charlene, the driver of the mtaxi, despite the fact that it's still work time, she wants to take a coffee
          and so ignores the request. After 5 mins MyTaxiService(B) tries to find a new maxi
          for Bob: Albert's Taxi is available and MyTaxiService(B) forwards Bob's request to it.
          Albert receives the request and alerts MyTaxiService(B) that he's going to take care of the ride.
          MyTaxiService alerts Bob that his taxi will arrive in 3 mins.
          The Taxi arrives, and in 10 min Bob reaches the meeting place. MyTaxiService(B)
          signals the behavior of Charlene to his supervisors, and, after a few weeks, Charlene receives a warning and a fine of 200€.

        2) It's Monday morning and Bob, an important manager of a very big company, as to attend an important
           conference on Tuesday at 9:00 AM. Unfortunately he has no one
           to take him to the airport on Tuesday morning, also he is very worried to miss his flight tomorrow
           morning due to the lack of available taxi.
           If he misses the conference, his boss will fire him! Suddenly he remember that MyTaxiService
           application give him the possibility to reserve a taxi ride.
           He pick-up his smartphone, opens the MyTaxiService app, enters his credentials and access to the application.
           On the main page he press the 'Reserve' button, a form appear and he enters the time of departure, the point of departure
           and the number of passengers(he himself) then he press the 'Submit' button. The MyTaxiService backend receives the request
           and after some calculus notify Bob of the successful registration of its request. Bob is very happy and continues
           its work with a smile on his face.
           [OK]

        3) It's Friday, 11 AM and Ann has been on holiday for three weeks. It's time to go home!
           Ann has booked her return flight for today at 12 AM. Ann has carefully planned the return trip, indeed
           yesterday she made a taxi ride reservation through the MyTaxiService web site, but the taxi is in late!
           So she take her smartphone opens the MyTaxiService application, enters her credentials and after a successful login
           she presses the 'View Status' button and discovers that her taxi is stuck in a terrible traffic jam.
           "I'll miss my flight!" she thinks, and starts to wait with the heart full of hope.[OK]

        4) Dave, an experienced taxi driver of the city, has received, through MyTaxiService, a request for a ride
           from a passenger. "It's not too much far from where i am now", he thinks, "It'll be easy", and notifies
           MyTaxiService that he'll take care of the request. He starts driving toward the passenger's position, but suddenly
           , while he's crossing a very busy crossroad,
           a reckless driver coming from the left crosses at high speed the crossroad and hits with violence
           Dave's taxi cab. Luckily nobody gets hurt, but Dave's taxi cabe has been seriously damaged.
           Dave cannot fulfill the passenger's request so he takes his smartphone, opens the MyTaxiService app,
           and taps the "REPORT ACCIDENT" button, he accesses a screen where he inserts the accident details and taps the "SUBMIT" button.
           MyTaxiService(B) receives the Dave's report and after some computations selects and notifies another driver to fulfill the passenger request.
           [OK]

        6)
          Ann, a young female student from Texas, is visiting Italy with his boyfriend Bob.
          It's Friday morning, they are walking on the streets of Milan and they're thinking
          about visiting the Expo on Saturday. Ann proposes to use a taxi to reach Expo's location and
          Bob agrees. Ann is a very cautious person so she thinks it's better to book a taxi, for this
          reason she searches on Google "taxi milano book" and discovers MyTaxiService.
          She downloads the app on her Iphone; she opens the app, which displays a login screen with
          a registration button, and taps that button being so redirected to a registration screen; she inserts
          her mail address, choses and confirm a password, accepts the legal
          terms of the app and taps the confirm button; after that Ann is ready to use the app.
          In order to book a taxi for Saturday for the Expo, Ann accesses the booking section of the app,
          taps the "ADD BOOKING" button and in the add booking screen inserts the Expo's location by selecting the right item in a dropdown menu, inserts the time and location of the picking
          , choses two passengers and taps the big "BOOK TAXI" button, MyTaxiService responds by alerting Ann that her booking
          has been processed successfully. Ann is happy about the fact that everything has proceeded without problems.
          Bob instead is not so happy because he thinks that the Milan's transportation system is perfect
          to reach Expo and its far way cheaper than taking a taxi. Bob and Ann have a brief discussion
          about this and, at the end, Ann agrees with Bob. Given that, Ann tries to undo the booking:
          she opens the app, she logs in, she accesses the booking section and there she sees her booking for Saturday, she taps
          the bin icon to delete the booking, she confirms her intention to do that and everything is done.

        7) It's Thursday, 14:00 and George, a young mtaxi driver, is driving in the city's center.
           He noticed many of his colleagues waiting for requests in their cabs.
           Meanwhile MyTaxiService(B), by making some analysis on the mtaxies' GPS data, realizes that there are too many mtaxies
           in the city's center in relation with the number of ride requests for that zone. The system also indentifies
           some zones of the city where the concentration of taxies is too low. According to a policy based on some statistical data
           MyTaxiService(B) decides to move 10 mtaxies, including the George's one, from the city's center to the city's zones mentioned above.
           As a consequence of that, George receives by MyTaxiService a notification that alerts him to move to zone C (one of the city's zones
           with low concentration of mtaxies). George start driving towards zone C and continues his work.
