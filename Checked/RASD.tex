\section{Introduction}
  \subsection{Purpose}
    This document represent the Requirement Analysis and Specification Document
    (RASD). The main goal of this document is to completely describe the system
    in terms of functional and non-functional requirements, to show the constraints and the limit
    of the software and simulate the typical use cases that will occur after the
    development. This document is intended to all developer and programmer who
    have to implement the requirements, to system analyst who want to integrate
    other system with this one, and could be used as a contractual basis between
    the customer and the developer.

  \subsection{Scope of the project}
    The aim of this project is to develop an application myTaxiService, a web/mobile applications that makes easier and quicker taking taxies.
    Thanks to MyTaxiService, anyone can request or book a taxi and get realtime information
    about how long it will take to be picked up or about taxi's current position and code.
    In addition, MyTaxiService provides an efficient way to allocate taxies by dividing the
    city in zones and using a queue based allocation system, in order to reduce the
    waiting time and city's traffic.

    \subsection{Goals}
      In this subsection we describe a set of high level goals that myTaxiService is proposed to achieve.\newline
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item Simplify and speed up the process of taking a taxi
        \begin{itemize}
          \item When a user has entered his taxi ride details and clicks or taps
          the request button, then MyTaxiService will find the first
          available taxi that fits for the inserted ride details, booking it to the user

          \item When a user has entered his taxi reservation details and clicks or taps
          the book button, then MyTaxiService will book a taxi that fits for the
          inserted booking details and for the indicated meeting time
        \end{itemize}
        \item Guarantee an efficient and fair management of taxi queues
          2.2 Guarantee a right distribution of taxies in the city

          2.3 Guarantee short taxi availability times and short waiting times
      \end{enumerate}
    \subsection{Glossary}
        \subsubsection{Terms disambiguation}
        - MyTaxiService(F) : The front end of MyTaxiService, that is to say the components
          of the application that manage the interaction with the user and the logic behind
          this interaction
        - MyTexiService(B) : The back end of MyTaxiService, that is to say the components
          of the application that manage the forwarding of the ride / reservation request with all
          their associated notifications, the search of available taxies that are compatible with the request/reservation inserted, and other internal
          tasks not exposed to the user or the taxies
        - MyTaxiService: MyTaxiService(F) + MyTaxiService(B)
        - Taxi driver: The person who is licensed to drive a taxi cab.
        - Taxi(with capital T): a taxi that uses the MyTaxiService
        - Request: An electronic message sent by a user through MyTaxiService(F)
          to MyTaxiService(B). This electronic message refers to the case in which the user wants to be picked up by a taxi asap.
        - Reservation: An electronic message sent by a user through MyTaxiService(F)
           to MyTaxiService(B). This electronic message refers to the case in which the user wants to be picked up by a taxi at a specific time.
        - Zone: An area of the city.
        - Credentials: A combination of username and password, used by a registered user to access the myTaxiService application.
        - Taxi ride: A movement of people, through a taxi cab, from one geogrphical point to another
        - Queue: A data structure managed with a FIFO(First in First Out) policy.
        - Taxi identifier: how we choose a valid identifier for a taxi? <- TARGA?
        - User: A person that wants to take a taxi and is not registered to MyTaxiService.
        - Registered User: A person that needs to take a taxi and is registered to MyTaxiService.

      \subsubsection{Acronyms}
        - RASD: Requirements Analysis and Specification Document
        - FIFO: First In First Out

    \subsection{Reference Documents}
      - Specification Document: MyTaxiService-AA2015-2016.pdf
      - IEEE Std 830-1998 IEEE Recommended Practice for Software Requirements Specifications.
      - IEEE Std 1016 tm -2009 Standard for Information Tecnology-System Design-Software Design Descriptions.
    \subsection{ASSUMPTIONS}
      1. MyTaxiService has been commissioned by the city local government.
        Each taxi in the city must have a taxi licence provided by the local government. This licence requires the registration to the myTaxiService
        and forces drivers to accept ride request/reservations only using MyTaxiService.
        During the registration process taxi drivers are asked to provide their personal and vehicle and work time table.
        At the end of the registration process each taxi will be provided an unique code.
        The city's local government provides each taxi with a device used to see incoming ride requests or reservations and
        to signal the acceptance of these ones, along with a gps device used to track the taxi's position.

        2. MyTaxiService is aware of the work time table of each taxi, so there's no need to consider
        the case in which a taxi has no pending requests but is not available: taxies are unavailable
        if and only if they are serving a ride/reservation request; an exception to this case is that a taxi could have an accident.  After a taxi has finished serving a passenger he has to notify that
        to myTaxiService and so myTaxiService will consider the taxi available again. Considering that myTaxiService knows the position
        of the taxi and the destination of each ride there is no chance a taxi drive can cheat by not signalling he hasn't yet finished service a passenger.

        3. Once a user sends a ride request, he or she cannot change any detail of the request nor can
          undo the request.

        4. MyTaxiService is aware of the characteristics of each taxies (number of passengers)

        5. MyTaxiService is aware of all the possible valid location in the city, so the user is forced to select one of them and not insert one of them.

        6. Taxi can accept only ride reservation/request within the city borders.

        7. Accepting a ride/reservation request by the taxi driver: signaling that the taxi has already left in order to pick a registered user up.

        8. Visitor: A generic person that is not registered to the service.


  2.1) Main Actors(Spostare nella sezione centrale)
    In this section are defined all the actors that interact with the myTaxiService during its operation.
      - Visitor
          A user can only see the login page and complete the registration(which is mandatory to use the service)
          to be able to access to all the functionality of the application.

      - Registered User
          A registered user can, after a successful login, access all the functionality of the application: it can
          request/reserve a taxi ride, view the status of older reservations and cancel a already confirmed taxi reservation.

      - Taxi driver
          A taxi driver, after a successful login, is granted to: being notified by the system of an incoming request,
          notify the system about the conclusion of a taxi ride.

      - MyTaxiService(B)
          This actor represent the back-end part of the myTaxiService software system, its main purpose is to forward request
          coming from users to a taxi available in the zone, also it has to collect informations relative to the availability
          of the taxi drivers.
