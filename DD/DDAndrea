1) Introduction

  - Purpose
    This document represent the Desing Document(DD)
    The purpose of the Design Document is to provide a medium/base level description of the design of MyTaxiService
    in order to allow for software development to proceed with an understanding of what is to be
    built and how it is expected to built.
    The main goal of this document is to completely describe the system-to-be by:
      - Detecting high-level components of the software to be
      - Describing how these components communicates and interact with each other
      - Describing how software components are distributed on the architecture's tiers
      - Motivating and describing the adopted architecture style

  - Scope
    The aim of this project is to develop MyTaxiService, a web/mobile application that
    makes easier and quicker taking taxies within the city’s borders. Thanks to MyTaxiService,
    anyone can request or book a taxi and get realtime information about how long
    it will take to be picked up or about the taxi’s current position and identification code.
    In addition to that, MyTaxiService provides an efficient way to allocate taxies by dividing
    the city in zones and using a queue based allocation system, in order to reduce the
    average waiting time and city’s traffic.
    This Software Design is focused on the base level system and critical parts
    of the system.

  - Document Structure
    - Introduction
      This section provides a general description of the Design Document by clearly stating purpose an aim of the project.
      It also include a disambiguation section to help the reader in the process of resolving the ambiguity generate by
      the use of natural language

    - Architecture Design
      The first part of this section provides a detailed description of the high-level components of MyTaxiService and of how
      these components interact.
      The second part introduces the architecture style chosen for MyTaxiService. The focus is on motivation, advantages and possible
      disadvantages of chosen architecture.

    - Algorithms Design
      The section aims to provide a very low-level description of some routine functionalities of MyTaxiService.
      Some code(Javascript???) is included

    - User Interface Design
      In this section are provided some mockups describing some base level requirements of the user interface to-be

    - Requirements Traceability
      This section provides a matrix of traceability that allows the reader to map functional requirements on the
      previously defined software components
