DESCRIPTION
MyTaxiService it's a mobile application that simplifies and speeds up the way people take taxies.
With MyTaxiService a user can request or reserve a taxi and get realtime information
about how long it will take to pick him up or about the taxi's current position and the taxi's code.
MyTaxiService also offers to every user the possibility of sharing a ride with other people and
provides an efficient way to allocate taxies by dividing the
city in zones and by using a queue based allocation system, so that the waiting time
for the user and the city's traffic are reduced.
