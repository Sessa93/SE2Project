DESCRIPTION
MyTaxiService is a mobile application that makes easier and quicker the way people take taxies.
Thanks to MyTaxiService, a user can request or book a taxi and get realtime information
about how long it will take to be picked up or about taxi's current position and code.
In addition, MyTaxiService provides an efficient way to allocate taxies by dividing the
city in zones and using a queue based allocation system, in order to reduce the
waiting time and city's traffic.

GOALS
1. Simplify and speed up the process of taking a taxi
  1.1 When a user has entered his taxi ride details and clicks or taps
      the request button, then MyTaxiService will find the first
      available taxi that fits for the inserted ride details, booking it to the user

  1.2 When a user has entered his taxi reservation details and clicks or taps
      the book button, then MyTaxiService will book a taxi tha fits for the
      inserted booking details and for the indicated meeting time

2. Guarantee an efficient and fair management of taxi queues
    2.2 Guarantee a right distribution of taxies in the city
    2.3 Guarantee short taxi availability times and short waiting times


PRELIMINARY ASSUMPTIONS
1. MyTaxiService has been commissioned by a company that gathers several taxies.
This company provides each taxi with a device used to see incoming ride requests or reservations and
to signal the acceptance of these ones, along with a gps device used to track the taxi's position.
Given that, each of the above mentioned taxies is forced to accept ride request/ reservations only
using MyTaxiService
2. MyTaxiService is aware of the work time table of each taxies, so there's no need to consider
the case in which a taxi has no pending request but is not available: taxies are unavailable
if and only if they are serving a ride/reservation request. There might be exception which will
be discussed later
3. Once a user sends a ride request, he or she cannot change any detail of the request nor can
undo the request
4. The amount of taxies available are enough to satisfy the medium number of ride
request or reservation
5. MyTaxiService is aware of the characteristics of each taxies (number of passengers)
6. The starting location associated with a taxi request / reservation is always accessible
by taxies
