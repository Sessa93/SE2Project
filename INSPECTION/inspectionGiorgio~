    All the if statements present in the body of this method
    do not use curly braces

    The javadoc written for this method is not sufficient to explain its role and its
    behavior in the context of the SSIServlet class. The javadoc written for this method is not sufficient to explain
    the reasons behind the throwing of a ServerletException

    All the comparisons present in the body of this method use improper
    operators(== or !== instead of equals or !..equals), in fact the elements in comparison
    are always objects(strings in particular)

    [Lines 115,121,123]
    In these lines we have the assignment of properties of the class, and this assignment does not
    depend from the result of previous instructions. Given that, these instructions should be
    put in the top of the body of the method


    None of the instructions present in the body of this method is commented. This may be
    correct if all these instructions are self explicative, but at least the last if statement
    needs comments to explain what it tries to achieve

    These lines exceed the length of 80 characters.

    In the body of this method continuos calls to the methods of the object returned by the
    getServletConfig() method are performed.
    This is inefficient since the above mentioned object can be stored in a local variable
    and so made accessible without method calls

    Methods and properties of the superclass of a class must be referenced by that class using
    the "super." prefix. This should be done for reasons of clarity and readability, so that
    the developer can immediately distinguish the manipulation of methods and properties of the superclass of the current class
    from the manipulation of those which belong to the current class.
    This behavior is not followed in this method[All lines]

    Methods and properties of the current class must be referenced within the class using the "this." prefix.
    This should be done for reasons of clarity and readability, so that the developer can immediately distinguish
    the manipulation of methods and properties of the current class from the manipulation of those which belong
    to the superclass of the current class. This is also useful for distinguish the manipulation of properties of
    the current class and local variables.
    This behavior is not followed in this method[Lines 124,127,134][Commented class version]

    [Line 113]
    The Integer.parseInt method wants an additional parameter which is an integer that speciefies
    the radix of the integer to be parsed out of the given string.
    The Integer.parseInt method throws a NumberFormatException which is not managed and must be imported.

    [Line 119]
    The Long.valueOf method throws a NumberFormatException which is not managed and must be imported

  Issues
    No javadoc has been written for this method

    None of the instructions present in the body of this method is commented. This may be
    correct if all these instructions are self explicative, but most of the instructions
    present in this method are not self explicative

    Lines 233,234,235,239
    In these lines local variables are defined and assigned to a value. Since these assigments and definitions
    do not depend from the result of previous instructions, they must be put in the top
    of the body of the method

    Lines 239
    In this line a local variable of the type "InputStreamReader" is defined. The name of
    this variable is "isr" which does not convey any immediate meaning about the role and the
    use of this variable

    Lines 233, 234
    The method openConnection throws an IOException that is not managed
    The method getInputStream throws an IOException that is not managed

    Line 265
    The getInputStream and getContentEncoding methods cannot be called on a "URLConnection" object before opening an actual connection
    to the resource referred by object itself (to solve this problem the "connect" method must be called on the
    "URLConnection" object before calling getInputStream)

    Line 230,255
    the getWriter method on the HttpServletResponse object throws a IOException, a IllegalStateException, UnsupportedEncodingException
    which are neither managed nor imported (IllegalStateException)

    Line 248
    The method close should be invoked on the bufferedReader variable and on the
    isr variable, since these variables are not used anymore in the rest of the method
    and they represent streams of bytes readers

    All the comparisons present in the body of this method use improper
